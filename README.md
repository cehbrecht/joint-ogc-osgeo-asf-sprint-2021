About the Code Sprint
----------------

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), and the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) invite software developers to a joint Virtual Code Sprint on the 17th, 18th and 19th of February 2021. The sprint will begin at 07:00am EST on the first day, and end at 05:30pm EST on the last day.

Register at https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/register/20210217_code_sprint.php

A Code Sprint is a collaborative and inclusive event driven by innovative and rapid programming with minimal process and organization constraints to support the development of new applications and candidate standards.

The goal of the code sprint is to advance support of open geospatial standards within the developer community, whilst also advancing the standards themselves. Therefore, the code sprint will enable software developers to focus on projects that implement open geospatial standards for a period of three days. The code sprint will cover multiple ASF, OSGeo projects and OGC standards - including **OGC API** standards. All OGC, OSGeo and ASF projects and working groups are invited to participate. This Sprint is open to all participants, even if you are not active members or contributors to the efforts of the hosting organizations.

About the Organizers
----------------

OGC is an international consortium of more than 500 businesses, government agencies, research organizations, and universities driven to make geospatial (location) information and services FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

OSGeo is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to foster global adoption of open geospatial technology by being an inclusive software foundation devoted to an open philosophy and participatory community driven development.

Since 1999, The Apache Software Foundation has been shepherding, developing, and incubating Open Source innovations "The Apache Way". The ASF's all-volunteer community comprising 813 individual Members and 8,000 Committers on six continents steward 200M+ lines of code, oversee 350+ Apache projects and their communities, and provide $20B+ worth of software to the public at 100% no cost.
